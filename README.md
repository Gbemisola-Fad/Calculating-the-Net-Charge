# Calculating-the-Net-Charge
 Calculating the Net Charge of Insulin by Using Python Lists and Loops

In this lab, I did:

1. Created a dictionary of pKa values (which indicate the strength of an acid) that will be used in the net charge calculations
2. Used the count() method to get a count of amino acids
3. Used a while loop to calculate the net charge of insulin from pH 0 to pH 14
